	abstract = {In this article, the feasibility of spacecraft recovery using rotative wings is analysed. This technology possesses the ability to perform a safe and controlled landing, allowing the spacecraft to be reused and utilised in missions with different requirements. A computational model that simulates the descent of a sounding rocket was developed. It is based on rotor’s aerodynamic theories and kinematics and computes several rotor parameters that allow the analysis of the system’s performance. The model’s validation and verification were successfully carried out by comparing its behaviour with literature data. To understand how each design parameter influences the system, a parametric study of the rotor design variables was held. It was concluded that the blade’s pitch angle is extremely important for the system’s performance and should be carefully selected, and that weight penalties resultant from excessive blade’s number or radius can be prejudicial. Furthermore, a design optimisation was conducted, aiming to minimise the rocket’s terminal velocity. Finally, a flare manoeuvre was disclosed to reduce the touchdown velocity. This recovery system is concluded to be highly promising, though requiring further work in several fields of study.},

The reference mission for this task is a mission currently under study at NASA, called the Mars Design Reference Mission, characterized by in-situ propellant production at Mars, and an abort to the Martian surface philosophy. This study consists of comparative evaluations to the reference mission with a view to selecting strategies that would reduce the cost and risk of the Mars program as a whole, as well as to understand the implications of certain Mars architectures, vehicle configurations, and mission enhancing technologies. Several propulsion elements were assessed, as well as the benefits of aerocapture, and vehicle reuse. Primary ground rules and assumptions were taken from NASA material used in Marshall Space Flight Center's own assessment done in late 1997. Results indicate that the Reference Mission (in its present form) adds additional risk without providing significant benefit when compared to either a special risk-mitigating variation of the Reference Mission, or to an appropriately designed non-ISPP alternative architecture. The Mars Direct mode, from which the Design Reference Mission evolved, is also discussed. Abort scenarios for several mission types are evaluated and critiqued.},

	abstract = {In the present work, effects of compressibility on the dynamic stall of NACA 0012 airfoil, pitching sinusoidally from 5.03° to 24.79°, are investigated computationally using implicit large eddy simulations in a finite difference framework. Simulations of two-dimensional (2D), high Reynolds number, compressible flows are carried out without any transition or turbulence model to capture the physics of the dynamic stall process. The problem is formulated in a body-fixed, rotating, non-inertial frame. High accuracy, dispersion relation preserving optimized upwind compact scheme is used to compute convective flux derivatives, and an optimized three-stage Runge-Kutta method is used for time integration. Results are presented for free stream Mach number M∞ = 0.283, 0.4, and 0.5, where the Mach number is varied independent of the Reynolds number. The computations have been quite successful in capturing the essential features of the dynamic stall mechanism. It is observed that dynamic moment and lift stalls occur at smaller angles of attack as the Mach number increases. Reduction in the size of airload hysteresis loops and maximum attainable load coefficients are observed with increasing Mach number. Weak shock waves are observed near the leading edge (LE) at M∞ = 0.4, and lambda-shock is formed near the LE for M∞ = 0.5. It is observed that with increasing Mach number, the impact of dynamic stall on the aerodynamic loads (Cl, Cd, and Cm) becomes less dramatic as the maximum value attained by these aerodynamic loads decreases with an increase in the Mach number. An increase in positive damping area in the hysteresis loop is observed with an increase in the Mach number, inhibiting possible vulnerability to stall flutter.},

	abstract = {Dynamic stall is an incredibly rich ﬂuid dynamics problem that manifests itself on an airfoil during rapid, transient motion in which the angle of incidence surpasses the static stall limit. It is an important element of many manmade and natural ﬂyers, including helicopters and supermaneuverable aircraft, and low–Reynolds number ﬂapping-wing birds and insects. The ﬂuid dynamic attributes that accompany dynamic stall include an eruption of vorticity that organizes into a well-deﬁned dynamic stall vortex and massive excursions in aerodynamic loads that can couple with the airfoil structural dynamics. The dynamic stall process is highly sensitive to surface roughness that can inﬂuence turbulent transition and to local compressibility effects that occur at free-stream Mach numbers that are otherwise incompressible. Under some conditions, dynamic stall can result in negative aerodynamic damping that leads to limit-cycle growth of structural vibrations and rapid mechanical failure. The mechanisms leading to negative damping have been a principal interest of recent experiments and analysis. Computational ﬂuid dynamic simulations and low-order models have not been good predictors so far. Large-eddy simulation could be a viable approach although it remains computationally intensive. The topic is technologically important owing to the desire to develop next-generation rotorcraft that employ adaptive rotor dynamic stall control.},

	abstract = {We present a tentative review of compressibility effects in Rayleigh–Taylor instability-induced flows. The linear, nonlinear and turbulent regimes are considered. We first make the classical distinction between the static compressibility or stratification, and the dynamic compressibility owing to the finite speed of sound. We then discuss the quasi-incompressible limits of the Navier–Stokes equations (i.e. the low-Mach number, anelastic and Boussinesq approximations). We also review some results about stratified compressible flows for which instability criteria have been derived rigorously. Two types of modes, convective and acoustic, are possible in these flows. Linear stability results for perfect fluids obtained from an analytical approach, as well as viscous fluid results obtained from numerical approaches, are also reviewed. In the turbulent regime, we introduce Chandrasekhar’s observation that the largest structures in the density fluctuations are determined by the initial conditions. The effects of compressibility obtained by numerical simulations in both the nonlinear and turbulent regimes are discussed. The modifications made to statistical models of fully developed turbulence in order to account for compressibility effects are also treated briefly. We also point out the analogy with turbulent compressible Kelvin–Helmholtz mixing layers and we suggest some lines for further investigations.},

Additionally, a module for the extrapolation of airfoil polars, beyond the stall point, for a 360° range of angles of attack is integrated. The resulting functionality allows the use of QBlade as a comprehensive tool for wind turbine design. QBlade is constantly being maintained, validated and advanced with new functionality.

The system developed is here used to design a 126-m diameter, three-bladed rotor, featuring minimal sensitivity to uncertainty associated with blade manufacturing tolerances. In particular, the uncertainty affecting the rotor geometry is associated with the radial distributions of blade chord and twist, and the airfoil thickness. In this study, both geometric and operative design variables are treated as part of the optimization. Airfoil aerodynamics and rotor aeroelasticity are predicted by means of XFOIL and FAST codes, respectively, and a novel deterministic method, the Univariate Reduced Quadrature, is used for uncertainty propagation. The optimization is performed by means of a two-stage multi-objective evolutionbased algorithm, aiming to maximize the rotor expected annual energy production and minimize its standard deviation. The design optimization is subjected to a single structural constrain associated with the maximum out-of-plane blade tip deﬂection. The results of this research highlight that a lower sensitivity to uncertainty tied to manufacturing tolerances can be achieved by lowering the angular speed of the rotor.},

Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory is extended to account analytically for the eﬀects of blockage and the development of the static pressure diﬀerence in the ﬂow passage and shows agreement in thrust and power predictions to within ± 3\% of equivalent blade resolved simulations. The conﬁned ﬂow BEM model is employed to study two diﬀerent power capping strategies: varying the rotational speed with ﬁxed pitch blades; and pitching the blades to feather at constant rotational speed. Pitch-to-feather achieves reduced thrust above rated ﬂow speed which leads to a greater extractable resource than achievable with overspeed control, due to the feedback between device thrust and available tidal resource. Flow conﬁnement is shown to reduce the ﬂow speed at which rated power occurs, and increases the rotor loads and power below rated conditions. It is also shown that root bending moments, which aﬀect fatigue damage rates, increase with ﬂow conﬁnement.},

In this method, the propeller blade is divided into several elements and it is assumed that there is no aerodynamic interaction amongst the elements. Furthermore, the equations from momentum and blade element theories are combined to obtain equations which are useful in blades design process. In the analysis, tip and root losses proposed by Prandtl are also implemented. The computation results are validated using Qblade software.

            A design-oriented model for the unsteady aerodynamics of a flapping wing has been developed using a modified strip theory approach. Within this constraint, vortex-wake effects are accounted for as well as partial leading edge suction and post stall behaviour. Also, the contributions of sectional mean angle of attack, camber, and friction drag are added, which allows this model to be used for the calculation of the average lift, as well as the thrust, power required, and propulsive efficiency of a flapping wing in equilibrium flight. An example of such calculations is presented in the performance prediction of a mechanical flying pterosaur replica.},

	abstract = {The ﬂapping equation for a rotating rigid helicopter blade is typically derived by considering 1) small ﬂap angle, 2) small induced angle of attack and 3) linear aerodynamics. However, the use of nonlinear aerodynamics can make the assumptions of small angles suspect. A general equation describing helicopter blade ﬂap dynamics for large ﬂap angle and large induced inﬂow angle of attack is derived in this paper with nonlinear aerodynamics . Numerical simulations are performed by solving the nonlinear ﬂapping ordinary differential equation for steady state conditions and the validity of the small angle approximations are examined. It is shown that the small ﬂapping assumption, and to a lesser extent, the small induced angle of attack assumption can lead to inaccurate predictions of the blade ﬂap response in certain ﬂight conditions for some rotors when nonlinear aerodynamics is considered.},

Numerical simulations were performed for two-dimensional (2D) pitching-plunging airfoils and three-dimensional (3D) flapping wings, mainly at hover conditions, using an in-house code called INSflow. The results were compared with available experimental data obtained in the water tunnel at the NRC-IAR. The investigation revealed that, at hover conditions, the vortices formed during the airfoil plunging motion may remain near the airfoil and affect new vortex formations, and thus the integral aerodynamic performance. In addition, the flow around the 3D insect-like wing is fully three-dimensional. The tip flow affects the flow separation, reducing the separation intensity. Two-dimensional calculations may over-predict the separation and the shedding vortices, thus affecting the generation of aerodynamic forces.},

We show a simple procedure to promote understanding of an existing but not fully understood engineering instability problem, when uncertainties in the numerical modelling and constraints in the experimental testing are present. It is proposed that continuation and bifurcation methods can play a significant role in developing numerical and experimental techniques for studying the nonlinear dynamics not only for rotating blades but also for other engineering systems with uncertainties and constraints.},

	abstract = {Current methods of airdropping payloads accurately use the autonomously guided parafoil systems. Such approaches have limited trajectory options, hence limited accuracy, and could deliver only one payload with one airdrop. The Samara Autorotating Wings (SAW) is disposable type of aerial deployment system proposed in this paper to drop light-weight electronic payloads to remote locations accurately. Using autorotation as its main technique of lift creation, the concept borrows the natural dispersion method from maple seeds and takes advantage of the gyroscopic stability of a spinning mass. It does not require any propulsion system on-board and is equipped with an actuator to change the angle of attack of the wing for directional control. The concept also features a collaborative autorotation mode whereby multiple wings are attached together to form a larger rotor hub that benefits from increased angular momentum and control authority which is especially important at higher altitudes where the air is less dense. Although there have been other works on using autorotation to deliver payloads, this is the first documented effort in using a collaborative form of autorotation. The chordwise geometrical wing shape of SAW is optimized to achieve the maximum lift force during its autorotating descent. A nonlinear control method is conceived to regulate the descent direction and speed of SAW. This proposed control scheme enables an omni-directional guide slope, allowing SAW to be more maneuverable than parafoils or fixed-wing type of aerial deployments. SAW with different numbers of wings are tested against each other for drop characteristics and control performance, in simulated models and in physical experiments that involve a vertical wind tunnel with and integrated motion-captured system and free-fall drop tests.},

Although considering the induced velocity constant over the disk causes considerable error in the load distribution along a blade, the revolutions per minute of the rotor and rate of descent are found to be negligibly affected for small angles of blade pitch. For high pitch angles, where blade stalling becomes important, the theoretical difference between blade load distributions obtained by considering induced velocity constant and variable may be expected to be enough to cause quantitative disagreement between the constant induced—velocity theory and experiment.},

In the current study, the unsteady behavior of the flow around a symmetric airfoil is considered as incidence angle increases. The flow patterns are presented for wide range of angles of attack values. The vortex pattern generated is analyzed numerically for different angles of attack at Re=1000 around NACA 0012 airfoil. At this Reynolds number, the flow is laminar and boundary layers are quite thick. Flow separation and unsteady vortex shedding is observed even at low angles of attack. For NACA 0012 airfoil, the unsteady vortex pattern is observed at about 8° angle of attack for Re=1000. Spectral analysis is performed for angles of attack ranging from 0° to 90°. It is presented that amplitude spectrum of lift coefficient (Cl) start to shows a peak at 8° for NACA 0012 and the aerodynamic forces presents oscillatory behavior afterwards. The effect of angle of attack to wake pattern and instantaneous and mean aerodynamic coefficients are discussed. The time-averaged streamlines, pressure and skin friction coefficients are analyzed to observe the vortex formation and separation from the airfoil upper surface at this low Reynolds number.},

Therefore, it is necessary to extrapolate the limited experimental data to obtain the data for the whole range of AoA. The present study uses 2 (two) methods which are Viterna and Montgomerie methods in order to extrapolate the performance of an airfoil. The formulas and procedures of both methods are presented and their application are also demonstrated using an airfoil shape of NACA23012. From this study, a relatively good agreement of the airfoil performance in terms of lift and drag coefficients can be found from computation results of the both methods.},

	abstract = {Flow separation in airfoils have been extensively studied to analyze the underlying physics of the phenomenon. The phenomenon being nonlinear requires tools to reveal various features involving stall, bifurcation, and transition to chaos. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of the ﬂow past a symmetric airfoil (NACA-0012) at 1,000 Reynolds number to compute the aerodynamic forces at different angles of attack (α). The time histories and spectral analysis reveal important features of nonlinear behavior in the ﬂow around the airfoil. We ﬁnd that the steady state temporal solutions for aerodynamic forces; lift and drag, contain both odd and even harmonics which indicate the presence of quadratic as well as cubic nonlinearity in the system. These results also help to understand nonlinear behavior of the system as a function of α. Considering the angle of attack for airfoil as a control parameter, we observe that to achieve the static stall, ﬂow becomes chaotic adopting a route through period-doubling and quasi-periodic regimes. Using phase portraits and Poincare maps between the states of the system, perioddoubling is observed in this nonlinear system at α = 22◦ leading to chaos at α = 27◦.},

Strip Theory and Thin Airfoil Theory have been used to model the wings and Blade Element Momentum Theory has been applied to analyse the propellers. The consequences of the interaction between the helicopter rotor and the compound elements (wing and propeller) have been analysed in detail. Besides the inclusion of this new functionality in the tool, the calculations of simple helicopter configurations have also been completed with the addition of the ground effect. Moreover, a different tool dedicated to the analysis of cyclocopters has been created.

	abstract = {A shaft is modelled using three-dimensional solid finite elements. The shear-deformation and rotary inertia effects are automatically included through the three-dimensional elasticity formulation. The formulation allows warping of plane cross-sections and takes care of gyroscopic effect. Unlike a beam element model, the present model allows the actual rotor geometry to be modelled. Shafts with complicated geometry can be modelled provided that the shaft cross-section has two axes of symmetry with equal or unequal second moment of areas. The acceleration of a point on the shaft is determined in inertial and rotating frames. It is found that the finite element formulation becomes much simpler in a rotating frame of reference that rotates about the centre-line of the bearings with an angular velocity equal to the shaft spin speed. The finite element formulation in the above frame is ideally suited to non-circular shafts with solid or hollow, prismatic or tapered sections and continuous or abrupt change in cross-sections. The shaft and the disc can be modelled using the same types of element and this makes it possible to take into account the flexibility of the disc. The formulation also allows edge cracks to be modelled. A two-dimensional model of shaft disc systems executing synchronous whirl on isotropic bearings is presented. The application of the two-dimensional formulation is limited but it reduces the number of degrees of freedom. The three-dimensional solid and two-dimensional plane stress finite element models are extensively validated using standard available results.},

	abstract = {The autorotation of a flat plate about its spanwise axis was experimentally studied. Most of the work was done with a wing mounted in the University of Michigan 5 × 7 ft low-speed wind tunnel. The measurements consisted of the unsteady lift, drag, angular acceleration and the wing rotation rate. The flow pattern was studied by means of smoke, tufts and a small model in a water tunnel.
            The flow pattern was very different from that over a static wing. The wing did not stall until it was nearly perpendicular to the free stream and the flow did not reattach to the lower surface until the wing had rotated well past zero angle of attack.
            
              The maximum and average lift, drag and angular acceleration were measured for Reynolds numbers from 25 000 to 250 000. At
              Re
              = 240 000 the maximum lift coefficient was 4·50 with an average value of 2·20, while the maximum drag coefficient was 4·30 with an average value of 1·60. The angular acceleration was small; the wing rotated at an almost constant angular velocity. The non-dimensional wing rotation rate was measured for Reynolds numbers from 1300 to 280 000 and approached an asymptotic limit of 0·35 for sufficiently high Reynolds numbers.
            
            The effect of applying driving and retarding torques to the wing was studied. As the rotation rate was increased above the free autorotation rate, the lift and drag increased. When the rotation rate was reduced by a retarding torque they both decreased. The power developed by the rotating wing was considerably less than for a windmill of the same frontal area.
            A variety of wing configurations were tested, including different airfoils and aspect ratios and spoilers mounted at various locations on the wing. However, except for spoilers that were so large that they prevented autorotation, none of these changes had a major effect on the gross properties of the autorotation phenomenon.
            Freely falling wings were also studied. For Reynolds numbers above 4000 the average lift and drag coefficients were comparable to those observed in the fixed axis tests and it appeared that the flow pattern was similar.},

The rise of China during the last decades has had compelling consequences in the international system/order, which is led by the United States, especially since the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War. China’s ambitions know no limits, and the country competes with the US in every domain including trade, politics, economic, military, and especially technology. The paper highlights the fact that the New Space Race (NSR) is primarily a technological competition which eventually can and will affect everyone on this planet. In this regard, the NSR has two main facets: space exploration and the weaponization of Space. The former refers to deep space exploration mainly to a manned mission on Mars, as the red planet is the ultimate prize, and the return of humans to the Moon. The latter refers to the development of sophisticated weapon systems and respectively defensive systems which can either threat or protect the great powers from competitors. In this NSR, each side has its comparative advantages, China cooperates with Russia; however, the US is leading the way because it has the advanced private space industry and more years of experience in space exploration than China, which is struggling to catch up. Undoubtedly, the NSR has already begun but it will take more years to be fully develop, leading the great powers, and their allies, to the edge of technology as they try to dominate in the last frontier for mankind.},

To date, regulation regarding medical screening, certiﬁcation, or guidelines for suborbital and orbital SFPs has been relegated to the commercial space companies. However, many organizations, ranging from space advocacy groups to academic institutions to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), have oﬀered input and recommendations for medical screening of SFPs for the industry’s consideration. Simultaneously, governmental space agencies have made progress in deﬁning appropriate preﬂight medical testing and medical standards and for those commercial providers that plan to provide access to the International Space Station (ISS).},

	abstract = {This Open Forum contribution critically interrogates the use of space race rhetoric in current discussions about artificial intelligence (AI). According to this rhetoric, similar to the space race of the twentieth century, AI development is portrayed as a rivalry among superpowers where one country will win and reap major benefits, while others will be left behind. Using this rhetoric to frame AI development tends to prioritize narrow and short-term economic interests over broader and longerterm societal needs. Three particularly problematic aspects of using space race narrative in AI discussions are highlighted: first, perceiving technology development globally as a zero-sum game; second, pressuring governments to regulate less; and third, prioritising high technologies over social issues. This contribution invites to challenge underlying political assumptions of the AI space race discourse and to open up conversations about alternative futures.},

            It is necessary to evaluate the performance of the main rotor in design stages of a rotorcraft to obtain the assumed lift force and low aerodynamic drag. This paper presents the CFD numerical analysis of the autorotating rotor under transient conditions. Auto-rotation is particularly important in the case of gyrocopters, while in the case of helicopters it is related to flight safety. The calculations allowed us to obtain aerodynamic forces and torque as a function of rotor azimuth for individual rotor blades. The analysis was performed for a rotor tilted by 15 degrees toward the airflow direction. A geometric model was created for the calculations and then a computational model was created in Ansys Fluent software. The k-ω SST model was adopted as the turbulence model which considers the turbulence kinetic energy and its unit dissipation. The obtained results are presented in a rotor and flow coordinate system.},

Different conditions, such as air speed, altitude, angle of release and the presence of wind, have a significant effect on the choice of the release moment to ensure target destruction. In this paper, a Six-degree of freedom (6DOF) mathematical model for the free fall bomb is presented describing the motion of the bomb in the three-dimensional space in the presence of stochastic winds. The aerodynamic coefficients for the free fall bomb are calculated through Missile Datcom computer program, however, these coefficients can be calculated either experimentally using the wind tunnel or a flight test; or mathematically through the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The stochastic wind affecting the trajectory of the bomb is defined by a velocity spectral represented by the Continuous Dryden Spectral. The contribution in this paper is the modeling and evaluation of the free fall bomb flight simulation in the presence of stochastic wind affecting the bomb flight trajectory.},

The AGV is a time-varying stochastic complex system including the 6DOF Model, aerodynamic model, and flight guidance and control system. Motivated by the advantages of the availability of a high-fidelity flight simulation model, this research focuses on designing a general nonlinear 6-DOF model of an AGV based on LabVIEW software. Moreover, the nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) approach is also used to control the AGV's attitude angles in roll, pitch, and yaw. The AGV states are divided into two groups based on their rate of response using the two-time scaled concept. The aerodynamic control surfaces serve as inputs in the NDI control law, which is suited for rapid variables. On the other hand, the outputs of the fast outer loop are used as inputs for the inner slow loop. The proposed technique's validity and effectiveness were demonstrated by simulation results for the AGV nonlinear attitude control system.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new method for controlling and guidance of guided gliding vehicle (GGV) is provided. In this regard, a hybrid structure of nonlinear optimal control has been proposed to minimize control effort. The inner loop has a regulating function that guarantees the stability of motion and rotation equations and reduces the effect of external disturbances. The outer loop provides optimal tracking with a straight line scroll criterion for the GGV. The use of state dependent Riccati equation control involves determining the appropriate state dependent coefﬁcient (SDC) form, which requires a complete understanding of the dynamics of the system. One of the methods for determining the relative dynamics of a nonlinear time-varying system and calculating SDC is the online identiﬁcation method. The advantage of this method in determination of the SDC is more evident when it is not possible to fully understand the dynamics of the system or external factors and disturbance affect the system. This method also eliminates the problem of uncertainty and accurate measurement of parameters. In other words, it provides an adaptive model for different conditions. In this paper, the ANFIS network has been used for the ﬁrst time for continuous and online identiﬁcation of the system dynamics and calculating SDC. In order to ensure the stability of identiﬁcation, the identiﬁer will be trained ﬁrst with the particle swarm optimization and the online backpropagation learning algorithm. The stability of the closed loop system with a proposed hybrid structure is investigated with the help of the Lyapunov function and the concept of passivity. The optimal and robust performance of the proposed framework has been investigated in terms of the ability to simultaneously pursue the target in the optimal path despite disturbance and optimize the control effort with multiple simulations.},

In the case of high-altitude supersonic sounding rockets, it is critically important to produce realistic trajectory predictions in a representative range of operational and environmental conditions as well as to produce reliable probability distributions of terminal locations. This article proposes a methodology to develop highﬁdelity ﬂight dynamics models that accurately capture aeroelastic, turbulence, atmospheric and other effects relevant to sounding rockets. The signiﬁcance of establishing a high-ﬁdelity model and of addressing such a problem in the context of developing a digital twin are discussed upfront, together with the key tools utilised in the analysis. In addition to state-of-the-art computational methods to determine the aerodynamic forces, moments and mass changes in various ﬂight regimes (including parachute release), a detailed methodology for incorporating the dynamic aeroelastic response of the rocket is presented. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through a simulation case study, which utilises data from an existing rocket prototype. Results corroborate the correct implementation of the proposed algorithms and provide foundations for future research on virtual sensing and digital twin for autonomous navigation and guidance.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations of ﬂow past a stationary circular cylinder at diﬀerent Reynolds numbers have been performed using a computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) solver that is based on the Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS). The results obtained are used to develop reduced-order models for the lift and drag coeﬃcients. The models do not only match the numerical simulation results in the time domain, but also in the spectral domain. They capture the steady-state region with excellent accuracy. Further, the models are veriﬁed by comparing their results in the transient region with their counterparts from the CFD simulations and a very good agreement is found. The work performed here is a step towards building models for vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) encountered in risers, spars, and other oﬀshore structures.},

	abstract = {In recent years, interplanetary exploration has gained significant momentum, leading to a focus on the development of launch vehicles. However, the critical technology of entry, descent and landing (EDL) mechanisms has not received the same level of attention and remains less mature and capable. To address this gap, we took advantage of the REXUS program to develop a pioneering EDL mechanism. We propose an alternative to conventional, parachute based landing vehicles by utilizing autorotation. Our approach enables future additions such as steerability, controllability, and the possibility of a soft landing. To validate the technique and our specific implementation, we conducted a sounding rocket experiment on REXUS29. The systems design is outlined with relevant design decisions and constraints, covering software, mechanics, electronics and control systems. Furthermore, an emphasis will also be the organization and setup of the team entirely made up and executed by students. The flight results on REXUS itself are presented, including the most important outcomes and possible reasons for mission failure. We have not archived an autorotation based landing, but provide a reliable way of building and operating such vehicles. Ultimately, future works and possibilities for improvements are outlined. The research presented in this paper highlights the need for continued exploration and development of EDL mechanisms for future interplanetary missions. By discussing our results, we hope to inspire further research in this area and contribute to the advancement of space exploration technology.},

	abstract = {The accurate modelling and simulation of vehicle dynamics is a fundamental prerequisite for the design and experimental ﬂight testing of aerospace vehicles. In the case of high-altitude supersonic sounding rockets, it is critically important to produce realistic trajectory predictions in a representative range of operational and environmental conditions as well as to produce reliable probability distributions of terminal locations. This article proposes a methodology to develop highﬁdelity ﬂight dynamics models that accurately capture aeroelastic, turbulence, atmospheric and other effects relevant to sounding rockets. The signiﬁcance of establishing a high-ﬁdelity model and of addressing such a problem in the context of developing a digital twin are discussed upfront, together with the key tools utilised in the analysis. In addition to state-of-the-art computational methods to determine the aerodynamic forces, moments and mass changes in various ﬂight regimes (including parachute release), a detailed methodology for incorporating the dynamic aeroelastic response of the rocket is presented. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through a simulation case study, which utilises data from an existing rocket prototype. Results corroborate the correct implementation of the proposed algorithms and provide foundations for future research on virtual sensing and digital twin for autonomous navigation and guidance.},

	abstract = {Humanity is striving to be an interplanetary species more than ever before. Therefore, not only launching but also landing is a key capability for any future spacecraft. Right now, the state of the art is either landing by parachute or a propulsive approach. Parachutes are hardly ever reused, hence not a good choice for reusable vehicles. Propulsive landings do provide reusability but demand fuel and oxidizer, which might only be safe to use for a limited amount of time, e.g. due to temperature constraints. A viable solution that combines controllability, reusability and does not require any fuel is available in the form of autorotation. This is not a new technology in itself. Helicopters use it for landing in case of an engine failure. However, in the context of space flight, this technology has hardly been investigated. This paper shall present a number of possibilities of theoretical utilization of an autorotation system for a Venus mission. The focus is on a number of different sized vehicles with different purposes that utilize autorotation. Furthermore the vehicles will be evaluated upon their deployment method. A mission can be a small atmospheric probe and deployed by a bigger mission or it can be a lander with direct re-entry. It is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of autorotation in these different scenarios. Furthermore, comparison of the viability of the missions upon different performance parameters is made. This includes TRL, overall complexity and especially in comparison with other decelerators. The goal is to create a baseline. It shows where missions might be able to benefit by the utilization of autorotation. The possible limits of the technology are also outlined in this paper.},

	abstract = {Daedalus goal is it to build and test an alternative form of descent mechanism for drops from very high altitudes. Since parachutes are not always the best option and sometimes hard to handle in space applications, there is a need for new and innovative ways to descend through an atmosphere without using any propellant at all. Inspired by the bionic design of the maple seed which gently falls to the ground using its ingenious natural design, Daedalus is building a SpaceSeed applying the same idea of a gentle descent for Re-entry missions. Such a mechanism can be more robust towards supersonic re-entry than a parachute and can also be less affected by the space environment or heat compared to traditional options. This can be especially useful when looking towards the challenges a future Mars mission would bring to the table, but applications of this are numerous, for example, could designs like this also have terrestrial usages like weather probes which would be able to withstand harsher winds than a parachute could. This is directly usable for a turbulent atmosphere like on Venus or even Jupiter. Besides, payload returns from LEO could be made with similar designs thereby removing some of the challenges one would face with a parachute or an actively propelled landing system. Daedalus wants to prove that this alternative is usable for real-life applications on earth and other planets.},

	abstract = {Current developments in the aerospace industry point towards more frequent interplanetary travel in the future. However, the main focus of developments is on launcher technology, yet the descent of interplanetary probes is of high importance for the success of future missions. Additionally, to the present landing approaches using either a powered descent requiring fuel or a combination of different parachutes, a third method is investigated in this project. The chosen approach is called autorotation and is commonly used in helicopters. When a helicopter suffers a loss of power, it can still land and even choose its landing site without the utilization of an engine. Similar to parachutes, the presented technology can be applied to various atmospheric conditions by modification of rotor and control parameters. Moreover, a rotor in autorotation can provide directional control and thus the choice of a landing site, which is not feasible using a parachute. All these factors make autorotation an interesting option as an entry descent and landing (EDL) technology for interplanetary missions. Our project, Daedalus 2 implements the autorotation landing strategy as part of the REXUS student project campaign under DLR / ESA / SNSA supervision. Since 2018 we are developing the SpaceSeed Mk.2, a technology demonstrator that incorporates a rotor and all necessary technological means to perform an autorotation EDL maneuver from an apogee of 80 km. The mission concept is laid out within the presented paper. This includes the main challenges like miniaturization of the SpaceSeed v2 due to the size constraints of the REXUS rocket or the used sensors for height and position determination. The importance of a technology demonstrator tested on a sounding rocket to prove the feasibility of our presented system is laid out in our publication. Furthermore, the custom development of electrical, mechanical and software sub systems is discussed. Additionally, the planned mission profile will be explained, including flight phases and different activities conducted by the SpaceSeeds during flight. Moreover, the main differences and improvements to Daedalus 1 are being discussed.},
