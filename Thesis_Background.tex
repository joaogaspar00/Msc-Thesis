Some overview of the underlying theory about the topic...

Remember to define an acronym the first time it is used.

The full acronym can be \acrfull{mdo}, that includes both its long definition~\acrlong{mdo} and short definition~\acrshort{mdo}.

The research should be supported with a comprehensive list of references.
These should appear whenever necessary, in the limit, from the first to the last chapter.

A reference can be cited in any of the following ways:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Citation mode \#1 - \quad \cite{Marta:AeroBest2021}
  \item Citation mode \#2 - \quad \citet{Marta:AeroBest2021}
  \item Citation mode \#3 - \quad \citep{Marta:AeroBest2021}
  \item Citation mode \#4 - \quad \citet*{Marta:AeroBest2021}
  \item Citation mode \#5 - \quad \citep*{Marta:AeroBest2021}
  \item Citation mode \#6 - \quad \citealt{Marta:AeroBest2021}
  \item Citation mode \#7 - \quad \citealp{Marta:AeroBest2021}
  \item Citation mode \#8 - \quad \citeauthor{Marta:AeroBest2021}
  \item Citation mode \#9 - \quad \citeyear{Marta:AeroBest2021}
  \item Citation mode \#10 - \quad \citeyearpar{Marta:AeroBest2021}
\end{itemize}

The references may include books~\cite{Marta:AeroBest2021}, articles in journals~\cite{Morgado:2022:SAMO}, part of a collection of books~\cite{jameson:adjointns}, articles in conferences~\cite{Alves:ICUAS:2022}, master theses~\cite{Pacheco:MSc} and PhD theses~\cite{Rodrigues:PhD}.

Several citations can be made simultaneously as \cite{Campos:2021:QJMAM,Alexandre:2020:PLOS}.

This is often the default bibliography style adopted (numbers following the citation order), according to the options:

{\tt \textbackslash usepackage\{natbib\}} in file {\tt Thesis\_Preamble.tex},\\
{\tt \textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrvnat\}} in file {\tt Thesis.tex}.\\

Notice however that this style can be changed from numerical citation order to authors' last name with the options:

{\tt \textbackslash usepackage[numbers]\{natbib\}} in file {\tt Thesis\_Preamble.tex},\\
{\tt \textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrvunsrtnat\}} in file {\tt Thesis.tex}. \\

Multiple citations are compressed when using the {\tt sort\&compress} option when loading the {\tt natbib} package as {\tt \textbackslash usepackage[numbers,sort\&compress]\{natbib\}} in file {\tt Thesis\_Preamble.tex}, resulting in citations like \cite{Pacheco:2024:JAUTO,Portugal:2024:MODELLING,Matos:2022:AEROSPACE,Rodrigues:2020:SAMO,Rodrigues:2019:RENE,Campos:2018:JSV,Rodrigues:2018:CAF,Campos:2015:GAFD,Marta:2014:JPP,Rodrigues:2014:SMO,Campos:2014:IJMS,Marta:2013:AIAAJ,Marta:2013:CAF,Marta:2010:CAF,Marta:2007:IJCFD}.
